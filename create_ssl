for creating ssl certificate  in host we will use certbot [a free organization provide ssl for host ]
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot-nginx
apt install python-certbot-nginx
certbot --nginx -d donainname.com -d www.donainname.com   <-|

it will ask email for first time provide a valid email so in case any problem it can provide support
after that it will ask for redirection like for any order you want to pass tour connection with ssl or not just enter y
and accept 

reload your server 
and try connection
